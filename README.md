Silly lil game I made for the Daydream jam

Game can be played on the itch.io website: https://blowupthenoobs.itch.io/iwbiadaintkts
Plays with WASD controls, uses mouse to aim and shoot

to open up the project on your computer you simply need to clone this repo, open unity hub, then find it on your disk and it should open up to exactly how I had it. Though if you don't have my exact version, it may prompt you to download it.
